<h3>Multi-Language Support</h3>

We support native API's including Swift & Kotlin so you can easily integrate Bitcoin in your preferred programming language.

<h3>Miniscript</h3>

Through Miniscript we support descriptors with generalized conditions. This provides wallets with first class support for very complex spending policies, without having to individually translate them into code.

<h3>Custom Block Data Sources</h3>

Use a local full node, an SPV node, or your own Electrum server with API access to source data about the blockchain. You choose exactly what's right for your project.

The core logic is feature rich allowing you to build any wallet from scratch on mobile, desktop and even WebAssembly.
